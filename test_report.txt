                [0mThere are so many career options to choose from. One must first consider their strengths, interests, and passions. It's also important to think about job availability, growth opportunity, and salary expectations. But ultimately, choosing a career is a personal decision that should reflect one's own goals, values and ambitions. It can be helpful to speak to professionals in fields of interest or work with a career coach to gain more clarity and make an informed decision. Remember, this choice isn't set in stone, people often change careers in their lifetime, so don't feel pressured to find the "perfect" option.[0m

[0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.[0m
